#TpBus: A lightweight plugin to handle teleportation transportation systems.

Usage:
1. Place a sign down and write down the following:
```
[BusStop]
(Route)
0
```
2. Right-click on the sign to activate it.
3. To add more bus stops on the same route, place down more signs and write down the following:
```
[BusStop]
(Route)

```
Players will be teleported from Bus stop no. 0, then Bus Stop no. 1, and so on.
